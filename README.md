Retail traders often trade without thoroughly analyzing their past performance, which leads to recurring mistakes and a lack of improvement. Most journaling options available in the market are either overly complicated, expensive, or lack the customization needed by individual traders. The motivation behind this project was to offer a lightweight, modular, and intelligent alternative.

This project aims to:
- Take in user-inputted trade and market data
- Clean, transform, and store it in relational (MySQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases
- Visualize trading patterns, equity curves, win/loss ratios, and more
- Train machine learning models to identify trade success likelihood and behavior clusters
- Enable natural language querying via LLMs to make the journal interactive and personalized
